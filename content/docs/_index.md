Welcome to the _ADORE.software Toolkit_!

The toolkit aims to support implementation of the [Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability](https://adore.software/declaration/). It provides examples of funder programs, policies, and resources for each of the Declarationâ€™s recommendations in the four areas of research software practice, research software ecosystem, research software personnel, and research software ethics. The Toolkit is a living resource â€“ it will be updated regularly to incorporate new information. Please make additions by contacting [info@researchsoft.org](info@researchsoft.org).
