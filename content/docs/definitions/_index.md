## Research Software
---

For the purpose of this Declaration, research software is defined as: “source code files,
algorithms, scripts, computational workflows and executables that were created during the
research process or for a research purpose. Software components (e.g., operating systems,
libraries, dependencies, packages, scripts, etc.) that are used for research but were not
created during or with a clear research intent should be considered software in research and
not research software. This differentiation may vary between disciplines.” ([Gruenpeter et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.5504016)), as implemented in [FAIR Principles for Research Software](https://rd-alliance.org/group/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg/outcomes/fair-principles-research-software-fair4rs-0) (FAIR4RS Principles).

## Research Software Infrastructure
---

Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) [A National Agenda for Research Software](https://zenodo.org/record/6378082) (2022) defines research software infrastructure in relation to other types of software: Software can come in many forms, including scripts, code, notebooks, computational workflows, libraries, modules, frameworks, utilities, and applications. Here we focus instead on what they get built for.

ANALYSIS CODE - capture research processes and methodology: the steps taken for tasks like data generation, preparation, analysis, and visualisation
PROTOTYPE TOOLS - demonstrate a new idea, method, or model for research
RESEARCH SOFTWARE INFRASTRUCTURE - capture more broadly accepted and used ideas, methods, and models for research

## Funders
---

For the purpose of the Declaration, a funder is an organisation that supports research software and/or the people who develop and maintain it. This definition fits traditional funding organisations that provide monetary and/or in-kind support to a recipient on the basis of grants or gifts, without any expectation of services or other tangible benefits from the recipient and typically with limited involvement in project management, operations, and governance. A traditional funder can (and often does) direct that their grant go towards a particular project, outcome, or deliverable, and can (and often does) set conditions on the way the support is utilised (adapted from [Dunks, 2021](https://investinopen.org/blog/funding-open-infrastructure-key-terms-and-concepts-in-our-analysis/)). Signatories and supporters of the Declaration are expected to self-identify, and could potentially range from government funding agencies and academic research institutes to private companies and philanthropic organisations.
