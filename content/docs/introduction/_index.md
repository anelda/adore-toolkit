The ADORE.software Toolkit aims to support implementation of the [Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability](https://adore.software/declaration/). It provides examples of funder programs, policies, and resources for each of the Declaration’s recommendations in the four areas of research software practice, research software ecosystem, research software personnel, and research software ethics. The Toolkit is a living resource – it will be updated regularly to incorporate new information. Please make additions by contacting [info@researchsoft.org](info@researchsoft.org).
