- European Commissionâ€™s Horizon Europe Framework Program: Enabling an operational, open, and FAIR EOSC ecosystem includes [Development of community-based approaches for ensuring and improving the quality of scientific software and code](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-infra-2023-eosc-01-02). Aims to promote quality of software and code across the different disciplines. Activities covered include those that foster alignment of existing initiatives by promoting coherence and developing community guidelines, and ensure integration of infrastructure, tools, and services. 
- Netherlands eScience Center [Open eScience Call 2023](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/calls-for-proposals/open-escience-call-2023-oec-2023/). Supports state-of-the-art and innovative research that requires the development and application of advanced research software.
- [Sage Concept Grants](https://www.methodspace.com/concept-grants). This program provides funding for innovative software solutions that support research in the social sciences. The grants are designed to fund new technological solutions that support the adoption, development, and application of established and emerging research methods, including quantitative, qualitative, mixed, and computational methods.
- National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS) [Administrative Supplements to Support Enhancement of Software Tools for Open Science](https://datascience.nih.gov/tools-and-analytics/administrative-supplements-to-support-enhancement-of-software-tools-for-open-science). These supplements aim to enhance the sustainability and impact of research software tools by enabling the use of best practices and design principles in software development and leveraging advances in computing in a modern data ecosystem.  
- Department of Energy (DoE) [Seed Collaborations for Software Sustainability](https://science.osti.gov/ascr/-/media/grants/pdf/foas/2023/SC_FOA_0002844.pdf). The Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program seeks to seed collaborations focused on software sustainability.  
- Multilateral investments:
    - [Research Software Funders Forum Working Group](https://www.researchsoft.org/funders-forum/) on a multilateral lateral funding call for research software. 
    - [G8 Research Councils Initiative on Software Toward Exascale Computing for Global Scale Issues](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2010/nsf10053/nsf10053.pdf) (NSF 10-025) was software-intensive but not software-focused (helped lead to formation of Belmont Forum).
    - [European Research Area Networks](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ddc85-european-research-area-networks-eranets/) (ERANETS) 
    - CHIST-ERA [Open & Reusable Research Data & Software](https://www.chistera.eu/call-ord-announcement) 
    - [Weave](https://weave-research.net/), supported by [Science Europe](https://scienceeurope.org/), is a bottom-up, cross-European initiative developed by European research funders to support excellent collaborative research projects across borders.
