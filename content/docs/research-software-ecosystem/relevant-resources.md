## What is research software sustainability?
---

- [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/about) (SSI). Sustainability means that the software you use today will be available – and continue to be improved and supported – in the future. Software Sustainability Institute’s [Approaches to software sustainability](https://software.ac.uk/resources/approaches-software-sustainability?_ga=2.115122055.1652334849.1681322065-1290706317.1681322065&_gl=1*1tteyyq*_ga*MTI5MDcwNjMxNy4xNjgxMzIyMDY1*_ga_KWSWSSDS69*MTY4MTMyMjA2NC4xLjEuMTY4MTMyMjA3OC4wLjAuMA..).

- Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) [Sustaining Research Software](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/sustaining-research-software/). Sustaining research software means: identifying pathways to support maintenance; sustaining roles which are themselves stable, inclusive, supported, and valued; and using tools and techniques for building better software.
