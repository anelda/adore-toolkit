## Software Management Plans
---

- Netherlands eScience Center [definition](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/knowledge-base/): A Software Management Plan (SMP) helps in deciding how to deal with research software that is being developed as part of projects. It is important to decide which software to keep alive, for how long, and who will be responsible for it. 
- Together with NWO and several Dutch research institutes, the Netherlands eScience Center has developed the [Practical Guide to Software Management Plans](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/national-guidelines-for-software-management-plans/).
