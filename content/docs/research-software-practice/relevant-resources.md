## General

- OECD Council [Recommendation on Access to Research Data from Public Funding](https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0347)
- UNESCO [Recommendation on Open Science](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949.locale=en). See also the UNESCO [Open Science Toolkit](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/toolkit)
- [Open Research Funders Group (ORFG) Policy Clause Bank and Policy Generator](https://info.chanzuckerberg.com/e3t/Ctc/GE+113/cT9XL04/VXdH875Y98ntN92BRSZw9CKwW1zSvF_4MmrVHN6rgBr73q3pBV1-WJV7CgPRCF4WRDMg-46cW7t6Chn4NvkBKW56pN8066Z38DW6b0cxm611dv3W71WDyp7_0MTmN5JY4Zcm0gmwVH7XBN13Fg2wW6tm9Fg4l_zr1W4kf-5T8C8G-lW94xwLC6JN8fjW4vF0GJ3Pph7lW7gqtkn60fj2cW1T9Hmm7hyPYCW3QQvC_8-Lb_FW8--QtZ2HgSRsW7WpsR_20KLbRW8_zFTS98cpyxW4N0Hzm6Qx1WBW4n-_Jl70k_z2V_Jr7B51645CW5B9ty44kKmvkVvfj4k1WtJpwW8RGyr37hCYdrW8qdxwx80DxPsW6mF7Jz7gYzkrW8dM8K_2pNtzgW31g8Gr6-CxX8W5gm8K88z2HKFW7ClwK-7QCLtMW8NRTwb1Kjy-B37951). This resource for open science policies includes a section on software code sharing. These resources offer an example of how to classify different levels of policies related to Research Software Practice. The [ORFG Policy Clause Bank](https://osf.io/7sh6k/) includes four policy levels: Level 1 - Encouraging but not requiring code/software sharing; Level 2/3 - Requiring code/software shared, no timing specified; Level 3 - Requiring underlying code/software shared immediately; and Level 4 - Requiring code/software sharing with open licensing. The [ORFG Policy Generator](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHgq8ewuBrsJ8aH9Cjo1dfSavRZDhJkeFlbujL9Pv1M-hkMQ/viewform) helps organisations to develop or modify policy to make the work they fund more openly available.  
- We need to talk about the lack of investment in digital research infrastructure ([Knowles et al., 2021(https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-021-00048-5)]) 
- Research software is essential for research data, so how should governments respond? ([Barker et al., 2021](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2021-12/))
